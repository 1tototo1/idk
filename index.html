  <P>M project is a smart garbage can that works on solar energy, wind energy, and normal electricity.IT has the selection of languages it supports almost all the languages. It also has a selection of types of garbage like wet, dry, plastic, metal, paper etc. Garbage like paper and wet wastes fall under Biodegradable. So the options will be like bio-degradable, non-degradable, metal, and plastic. The bio-degradable wastes will be thrown in the soil the machine itself will dig and cover it with soil. and the rest will be sent by a tube, which is at least 120 cm ( in a plastic garbage cover). The waste gets sent to a garbage collection place, where it is operated by government employees.  The people can operate it easily with their mobile phones or in physical contact, or by voice control. The garbage can is surrounded by cameras which ahs night vision. They catch people if they purposefully litter stuff or disturb people, it can be recorded with audio. The recording has a privacy mode where the faces will be blurred for security reasons. After every use, it auto-cleans the front side, the back side, and the sides!!. The government employees can easily spot the problems happening and at last it records every use with a bill where no money is submitted, just how many kilograms are submitted per 1 week. </p>
